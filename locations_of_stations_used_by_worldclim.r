# Craig Phillips 20211005: This script doesn't actually get or provide access to climate data. Rather it shows the locations of climate stations that contributed data to WorldClim (WC). MPI has specified that--for the pairwise location vs location climate match part of the work--it wants us to use actual climate station data rather than WC data. I think this is because WC data are gridded, thus data for some WC locations without climate stations must be spatially interpolated (& perhaps inaccurate). However, we would avoid any spatial interpolation if we used the subset of WC data that came directly from climate station locations. This would have 2 main benefits: 1) The same WC data could be used in both the climate station vs climate station pairwise comparisons & the NZ vs world comparisions; 2) The WC data are already nicely formatted for our needs (unlike raw NOAA data). I will ask MPI about this idea.
# Craig Phillips 20211101: Discussed using WC data from climate station locations with MPI on 20211006 & they agreed. On the same day I emailed a leaflet map of WC climate station locations (produced by this script) to Stephan Halloy & Ursula Torres (cc, FT & JK) & asked them to choose the locations they would like to use. (I also pushed the leaflet map to this current "Worldclim-stations" repo to.) SH & UT agreed, but none sent to us, so at our next meeting I asked if they could at least choose a few for us to start developing a workflow with: However, as of today still no response.
# We should go ahead & choose 10 or so stations ourselves to start developing the workflow. Today I asked FT to choose 10 locations then write a script for extracting their climate variables from WorldClim rasters. Suggested as a starting point for that script he could copy "crop_worldclim_monthly_to_nz_and_save_dataframe.r" from my "world_clim" GitHub repo. 
# After we have the data, we can calculate CMIs between each pair. It might be good to do this with our R version of MCR because it won't be computationally intensive, & using the R version will get me started on refining it for NCSU.
